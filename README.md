floatbeat
=========

A programmatic sound/music generator inspired by bytebeat.
Also an excuse to do something in Go.

Uses code.google.com/p/portaudio-go/portaudio

The idea is for the generator to watch a file which defines what it will play,
using some kind of language halfway between math and ABC,
about which I have only vague ideas.
